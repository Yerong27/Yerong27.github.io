You bet I chose to be a Melburnian because this city hosts the Australian Open! Reading and running also keep me busy and fulfilled these days.
A dreamer and a doer. The past ten years in the accounting and finance field before switching to tech recently.
This is my cyber home, full with my random thoughts and stupid poems.</description></item><item><title>Love is not fair on its own</title><link>https://yerong27.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 17:38:19 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://yerong27.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Love is not fair on its own
Like the dark side of the Moon
The scale tilts to the side
Where hearts with heavy desire reside
Countless plays abide by one rule
One soul on fire —
Till it cools
A burning gaze —
Rests upon a nameless bloom
Scorched —
Descending into the tomb</description></item></channel></rss>
